# coding-events

The purpose of this app is to create a database of events, including details, contact information and
tags. Eventually, users will be able to create profiles and sign up for these events.

To be completely clear, this version of the app is out of date and broken as of June 23, 2021. I have an
undiagnosed error and had to begin using the coding-events-demo repo. I intend to compare the demo version to
this version, but I have not figured out how to do that in intelliJ yet.

I would like the future possibility of adding a Person class. This class would have fields like username,
name, birthday, password, verify password, past events and interests. They would also need a primary key of
userID number.

This class would also necessitate the need of various other classes. Interests could be similar to the
tags class for events. Person categories could include age ranges.
