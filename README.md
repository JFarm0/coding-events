# coding-events

The purpose of this app is to create a database of events, including details, contact information and
tags. Eventually, users will be able to create profiles and sign up for these events.

I would like the future possibility of adding a Person class. This class would have fields like username,
name, birthday, password, verify password, past events and interests. They would also need a primary key of
userID number.

This class would also necessitate the need of various other classes. Interests could be similar to the
tags class for events. Person categories could include age ranges.
